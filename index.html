            Starting with Borland C++ Builder 5 and Macromedia Flash 5 got me into
            programming. Back then I found that building games was always more fun to me than
            just playing them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Naturally I moved towards Web Development and started using PHP and JavaScript
            (which i still do with
            <a href="//laravel.com" target="_blank"
                class="bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-b from-red-500 to-red-600 text-xl underline underline-offset-4 decoration-sky-500">Laravel</a>üòç).
        </p>
        <p>
            Around 2008 I worked on Facebook games and in 2010 I started working with Unity
            and Unreal Engine as a hobby. I did build and release 4 games using Unity and C#.

            Architecting solutions for scalable and reliable web applications with high availability and
            security in mind is what I strive for. Achieving this by being on the cutting edge of
            technology while staying pragmatic is part of my daily working pleasures ü§ì.
