# Hello World
version 1.0.0

I am Senior Lead Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience.

Starting with Borland C++ Builder 5 and Macromedia Flash 5 got me into
programming. Back then I found that building games was always more fun to me than
just playing them.

Naturally I moved towards Web Development and started using PHP and JavaScript
(which i still do with Laravelüòç and TypeScript). Around 2008 I worked on Facebook games
and in 2010 I started working with Unity and Unreal Engine as a hobby. I did build and
release 4 games using Unity and C#.

Architecting solutions for scalable and reliable web applications with high availability and
security in mind is what I strive for. Achieving this by being on the cutting edge of
technology while staying pragmatic.
